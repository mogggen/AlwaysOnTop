Forked from [wnipper](https://github.com/wnipper/AlwaysOnTop)

~~Original: https://github.com/jparnell8839/AlwaysOnTop~~ not frequently updated as of 2025

# Explanation

The Purpose of this fork is to be used in a time taking widget for work.
It will not have the same functionality as previous iteration.

# Goal

Make the AlwaysOnTop property a feature to the program, no manual turn-on action required.
`Decimal Counter`* will be trivial so iteration can be re-used in other .

\* "The (second) hardest thing in programming etc."

Changing the name to be less Explicit to "AlwaysOnTopConfig".
Not renaming it from "AlwaysOnTopConfig" until there is a unique functionality to this fork.
